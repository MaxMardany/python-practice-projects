# Python Practice Projects

This repository contains my beginner-to-intermediate level Python projects as I complete the freeCodeCamp [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification.

These exercises are helping me build fluency in logic, problem-solving, and scripting as I transition into robotics, automation, and technical systems support roles.

## ðŸ§  Skills Practiced

- Function building and error handling
- String manipulation and formatting
- Logic and conditionals
- Step-by-step problem solving

## ðŸ”§ Featured Projects

- `arithmetic_formatter.py` â€” Formats arithmetic problems vertically with strict input validation (FreeCodeCamp project)
- `lambda_expense_tracker.py` â€” Practice using lambda functions and list filtering
- More coming soon as I progress through the course!
